# tgNetDisc
- 🤖Use the Telegram interface (requires a foreign VPS), ♾️️ unlimited capacity, no 🚫limits on file formats, no 🚫limits on file content😏, takes up very little memory and disk space📁, lightweight and convenient.
- Files are stored on Telegram☁️ side, with good security🔒 and sustainability.
- Large files will be uploaded in parts (not fast), but uploading very large files is not supported.
- Successful upload will generate external links in the form of HTML, Markdown, and BBCode🔗, which can be used as image beds and file download URLs.
- Test address:☞[tgNetDisc](https://yo.yohann.buzz/netdisc)☜
- Original Author's Address:[https://github.com/csznet/tgState](https://github.com/csznet/tgState), On this basis, some modifications are made.

## Docker One-click deployment (recommended 🏆)
- `TOKEN`is a bot token.
- `CHANNEL`It can be the channel address or the chatId (which can be obtained through the bot [@getidsbot](https://t.me/getidsbot)). If it is a channel, you need to make the channel public, pull the bot into the channel, set it as an administrator, and the channel address format is as follows: `@yohannChannl`. If it is chatId, you can get the file id (base64 encoding) through the private chat bot, reference file (video files around 3MB~10MB are not supported, the pro-test will directly stop the service, fragmented files of more than 10MB, reference `fileAll.txt` is supported) and reply `get` to get the file id (base64 encoding), through `domain name`+`/d`+`file id` can directly download the file, if it is a picture, you can view it directly.

Pull the personal registry image and start the container:

```bash
docker run -d --network=host \
--name netdisc \
-e TOKEN=xxx \
-e CHANNEL=xxx \
-e MODE=pan \
yohannfan/yohann-netdisc:1.0
```

## The binary executable starts
```
./tgState -token xxxx -channel @xxxx
```

Replace xxxx with your bot token and @xxxx with the channel address or personal ID (for personal IDs, only use numbers without @).

To customize the port, use the -port parameter, for example:

```
-port 8888
```

If you don't need the homepage and only want the API and image display page, use the -index parameter, like this:

```
./tgState -token xxxx -channel @xxxx -port 8888 -index
```

To enable password protection, use the -pass parameter, for example, to set the password as csznet:

```
./tgState -token xxxx -channel @xxxx -port 8888 -pass csznet
```

For cloud storage mode, use the -mode pan parameter, like this:

```
./tgState -token xxxx -channel @xxxx -port 8888 -mode pan
```
